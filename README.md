## Introduction

This simple and fun game is a throwback to Atari's [Freeway](https://www.retrogames.cz/play_123-Atari2600.php) and Konami's [Frogger](https://www.classicgamesarcade.com/game/21607/frogger.html). Younger players will recognize the similarities to the recent Disney's [Crossy Road](https://g.co/kgs/S7oA3p).
